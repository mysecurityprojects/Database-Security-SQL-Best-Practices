# SQL-Database-Best-Practices

Database security faces an evolving set of challenges stemming from technical vulnerabilities, human error and malicious intent. According to *BREACHSENSE*, there were over 4100 publicly disclosed data breaches in 2024. Nearly 109 million affected accounts of those cyber incidents occurred in the 3rd quarter costing an average of $4.88M per incident.  

The following are important concepts and SQL commands that can be implemented in SQL databases to prevent data from being compromised:

1.**AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION**


**Create a login with a strong password**

  CREATE LOGIN [NewUser] WITH PASSWORD = 'StR0nG_p@ssW0rd!';

2. **ENCRYPT DATA IN REST AND IN TRANSIT**

3. **PREVENT SQL INJECTION ATTACKS**

4. **MONITOR AND AUDIT DATABASE ACTIVITY**
